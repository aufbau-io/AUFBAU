				Trans. Rolf A. George, Berkeley 1967 - Rudolf Carnap, Aufbau, Preface to the First Edition (
				Vienna, May 1928 ) - What is the purpose of a scientific book? It is meant to convince the
				reader of the validity of the thoughts which it presents. However, this may not completely
				satisfy the reader; she may want to know, in addition, whence these thoughts came and where
				they lead, whether there are movements in other areas of inquiry with which they are
				connected. Only the book as a whole can demonstrate that the thoughts are correct. Here,
				outside of the framework of the theory, a brief answer to the second question may be
				attempted: what position in contemporary philosophy and contemporary life in general does
				this book occupy? In the last few decades mathematicians have developed a new logic. They
				were forced to do this from necessity, namely by the foundation crisis of mathematics, in
				which traditional logic had proved an utter failure. It not only proved incapable of dealing
				with these difficult problems but something much worse happened, the worst fate that can
				befall a scientific theory: it led to contradictions. This was the strongest motive for the
				development of the new logic. The new logic avoided the contradictions of traditional logic,
				but aside from this purely negative virtue, it has already given proof of its positive
				capabilities, though only by examining and reestablishing the foundations of mathematics. It
				is understandable that the new logic has, to begin with, found attention only in the narrow
				circle of mathematicians and logicians. Its outstanding importance for philosophy as a whole
				has been realized only by a few; its application to this wider field has hardly begun. As
				soon as philosophers are willing to follow a scientific course (in the strict sense), they
				will not be able to avoid using this penetrating and efficient method for the clarification
				of concepts and the purification of problems. This book is to go a step along this road and
				to encourage further steps in the same direction. We are here concerned, in the main, with
				questions of epistemology, that is with questions of the reduction of cognitions1 to one
				another. The fruitfulness of the new method is shown by the fact that the answer to the
				question of reduction can be provided through a uniform reductional system of the concepts
				which occur in science. This system is much like a genealogy; it requires only a few root
				concepts. It can be expected that such a clarification of the relation of the scientific
				concepts to one another will also put in a new light several of the more general problems of
				philosophy. It will turn out that some problems are considerably simplified through the
				epistemological insights which are obtained in this way; others turn out to be mere
				pseudoproblems. But these additional tasks are only briefly mentioned in this book. Here is
				a wide, largely untilled, field which awaits our attention. The basic orientation and the
				line of thought of this book are not property and achievement of the author alone but belong
				to a certain scientific atmosphere which is neither created nor maintained by any single
				individual. The thoughts which I have written down here are supported by a group of active
				or receptive collaborators. This group has in common especially a certain basic scientific
				orientation. That they have turned away from traditional philosophy is only a negative
				characteristic. The positive features are more important; it is not easy to describe them,
				but I shall try to give a loose characterization. The new type of philosophy has arisen in
				close contact with the work of the special sciences, especially mathematics and physics.
				Consequently they have taken the strict and responsible orientation of the scientific
				investigator as their guideline for philosophical work, while the attitude of the
				traditional philosopher is more like that of a poet. This new attitude not only changes the
				style of thinking but also the type of problem that is posed. The individual no longer
				undertakes to erect in one bold stroke an entire system of philosophy. Rather, each works at
				his special place within the one unified science. For the physicist and the historian this
				orientation is commonplace, but in philosophy we witness the spectacle (which must be
				depressing to a person of scientific orientation) that one after another and side by side a
				multiplicity of incompatible philosophical systems is erected. If we allot to the individual
				in philosophical work as in the special sciences only a partial task, then we can look with
				more confidence into the future: in slow careful construction insight after insight will be
				won. Each collaborator contributes only what she can endorse and justify before the whole
				body of his co-workers. Thus stone will be carefully added to stone and a safe building will
				be erected at which each following generation can continue to work. This requirement for
				justification and conclusive foundation of each thesis will eliminate all speculative and
				poetic work from philosophy. As soon as we began to take seriously the requirement of
				scientific strictness, the necessary result was that all of metaphysics was banished from
				philosophy, since its theses cannot be rationally justified. It must be possible to give a
				rational foundation for each scientific thesis, but this does not mean that such a thesis
				must always be discovered rationally, that is, through an exercise of the understanding
				alone. After all, the basic orientation and the direction of interests are not the result of
				deliberation, but are determined by emotions, drives, dispositions, and general living
				conditions. This does not only hold for philosophy but also for the most rational of
				sciences, namely physics and mathematics. The decisive factor is, however, that for the
				justification of a thesis the physicist does not cite irrational factors, but gives a purely
				empirical-rational justification. We demand the same from ourselves in our philosophical
				work. The practical handling of philosophical problems and the discovery of their solutions
				does not have to be purely intellectual, but will always contain emotional elements and
				intuitive methods. The justification, however, has to take place before the forum of the
				understanding; here we must not refer to our intuition or emotional needs. We too, have
				"emotional needs" in philosophy, but they are filled by clarity of concepts, precision of
				methods, responsible theses, achievement through co√∂peration in which each individual plays
				his part. We do not deceive ourselves about the fact that movements in metaphysical
				philosophy and religion which are critical of such an orientation have again become very
				influential of late. Whence then our confidence that our call for clarity, for a science
				that is free from metaphysics, will be heard? It stems from the knowledge or, to put it some
				what more carefully, from the belief that these opposing powers belong to the past. We feel
				that there is an inner kinship between the attitude on which our philosophical work is
				founded and the intellectual attitude which presently manifests itself in entirely different
				walks of life; we feel this orientation in artistic movements, especially in architecture,
				and in movements which strive for meaningful forms of personal and collective life, of
				education, and of external organization in general. We feel all around us the same basic
				orientation, the same style of thinking and doing. It is an orientation which demands
				clarity everywhere, but which realizes that the fabric of life can never quite be
				comprehended. It makes us pay careful attention to detail and at the same time recognizes
				the great lines which run through the whole. It is an orientation which acknowledges the
				bonds that tie men together, but at the same time strives for free development of the
				individual. Our work is carried by the faith that this attitude will win the future.
